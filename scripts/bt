# Purpose: Connect bluetooth headphones
#
# Dependencies: bluez, bluez-utils, bluez-libs
#
# If you consistently have troubles connecting, even after using bt off, you will
# need to restart your audio manager, reset device list on headphones (if applicable), put headphones
# in pairing mode, run bluetoothctl, power on, agent on, default-agent, scan on, pair $MAC, trust
# $MAC, connect $MAC
#
# If you receive error "Could not find default agent", try removing bluetooth dongle
# from USB port and plug back in.
#
# If you receive error "Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed br-connection-profile-unavailable"
# and you are using pipewire-pulse, try running: wireplumber & disown
